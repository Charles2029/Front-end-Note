In the final article in our series, we take the example toolchain we built up in the previous article and add to it so that we can deploy our sample app. We push the code to GitHub, deploy it using Netlify, and even show you how to add a simple test into the process.

For this project, we're going to use Netlify's wonderful static hosting offering to host our project. Netlify gives us hosting or more specifically, a URL to view your project online and to share it with your friends, family, and colleagues.

Netlify, amongst other things, also allows you to run pre-deployment tasks, which in our case means that all the production code build processes can be performed inside of Netlify and if the build is successful, the website changes will be deployed.
