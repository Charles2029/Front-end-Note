#Working with JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa). You'll come across it quite often, so in this article, we give you all you need to work with JSON using JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON.//

JSON exists as a string — useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to access the data. This is not a big issue — JavaScript provides a global JSON object that has methods available for converting between the two.

 Note: Converting a string to a native object is called deserialization, while converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network is called serialization.

 To access data further down the hierarchy, you have to chain the required property names and array indexes together. For example, to access the third superpower of the second hero listed in the members list, you'd do this:

 superHeroes["members"][1]["powers"][2];

superHeroes["members"][1]["powers"][12];

JSON is purely a string with a specified data format - it contains only peoperties, no methods.
JSON requires double quotes to be used around strings and  property names.Single quotes are not valid other than surrounding the entire JSON string.
Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong, and not work. You should be careful to validate any data you are attempting to use (although computer-generaated JSON is less likely to include errors, as long as the generator program is working correctly).
you can validate JSON using an application like JSONLint.https://jsonlint.com/
JSON can actually take the form of any data type that is valid for inclusion inside JSON, not just arrays or objects. So for example, a single string or number would be valid JSON.
Unlike in JavaScript code in which object properties may be unquoted , in JSON only quoted strings may be used as properties.
